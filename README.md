# Python with Football - Data Visualization & Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on football data analysis and visualization using StatsBomb open data. It extracts, processes, and visualizes match events such as passes, shots, and team movements using Python libraries like `mplsoccer`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches football match event data from StatsBomb.
- **Data Processing**: Uses `pandas` to clean and manipulate event data.
- **Visualization**: Employs `mplsoccer` and `matplotlib` to create tactical pitch maps and passing networks.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install mplsoccer pandas matplotlib requests
```

## Usage
1. **Load and Explore Data**: Fetch event data from StatsBomb and process it with `pandas`.
2. **Filter Events**: Extract passes, shots, and possession sequences.
3. **Visualize**: Generate football pitch visualizations with passing networks.

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis and visualization steps.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `mplsoccer`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `requests`

## Dataset
The data is sourced from [StatsBomb Open Data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data), which provides publicly available football match event data.

## Acknowledgments
- [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/) for providing the open dataset.
- [mplsoccer](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/) for football-specific visualizations.
